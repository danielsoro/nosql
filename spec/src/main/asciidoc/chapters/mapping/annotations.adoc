=== Models Annotation



Jakarta NoSQL has support for those three types:

* @Entity
* @Column
* @Id

The Jakarta NoSQL Mapping API does not require getter and setter methods to fields. However, the Entity class must have a non-private constructor with no parameters.

===== @Entity

This annotation maps the class to Jakarta NoSQL. There is a single value attribute that specifies the column family name, the document collection name, etc. The default value is the simple name of the class. For example, given the `org.jakarta.nosql.demo.Person` class, the default name will be `Person`.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {
}
----

[source,java]
----
@Entity("ThePerson")
public class Person {
}
----

An entity that is a field will be incorporated as a sub-entity. For example, in a Document, the entity field will be converted to a sub-document.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private Address address;
}

@Entity
public class Address {

    @Column
    private String street;

    @Column
    private String city;
}
----

[source,json]
----
{
   "_id":10,
   "name":"Ada Lovelave",
   "address":{
      "city":"SÃ£o Paulo",
      "street":"Av Nove de Julho"
   }
}
----

===== @Column

This annotation defines which fields that belong to an Entity will be persisted. There is a single attribute that specifies that name in Database with a default value that is the field name as declared in the class. This annotation is mandatory for non-Key-Value database types. In Key-Value types, only the Key needs to be identified with the `@Key` annotation. All other fields are stored as a single BLOB.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {
    @Column
    private String nickname;

    @Column("personName")
    private String name;

    @Column
    private List<String> phones;

    // ignored
    private String address;
}
----

===== @Id

This annotation defines which attribute is the entity's ID, or the Key in Key-Value databases. In such a case, the Value is the remaining information. It has a single attribute (like `@Column`) to define the native name. Unlike `@Column`, the default value is `_id`.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    private String userName;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private List<String> phones;
}
