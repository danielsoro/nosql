=== Annotations

Jakarta NoSQL is a popular specification that provides a standardized way for Java developers to work with non-relational databases. One of the key features of this specification is the use of Java annotations, which provide a simple and intuitive way for developers to map Java objects to NoSQL databases. These annotations allow developers to specify the structure of their data and the relationships between different objects without having to write complex code or queries.

Using Java annotations, developers can significantly simplify their workflow and reduce the time and effort required to work with NoSQL databases. Annotations also make it easier to maintain code and reduce the risk of errors since the database structure is defined clearly and concisely. Additionally, annotations provide high flexibility and customization, allowing developers to tailor the database schema to their specific needs.

Using Java annotations in Jakarta NoSQL represents a significant step forward for developers working with non-relational databases. By providing a standardized approach to mapping Java objects to NoSQL databases, this specification makes working with these robust data storage solutions more effortless and efficient.

Jakarta NoSQL has support for those three types:

* @Entity
* @Column
* @Id

==== @Entity

This annotation maps the class to Jakarta NoSQL. There is a single value attribute that specifies the column family name, the document collection name, etc. The default value is the simple name of the class. For example, given the `org.jakarta.nosql.demo.Person` class, the default name will be `Person`.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {
}
----

[source,java]
----
@Entity("ThePerson")
public class Person {
}
----

You can include one or multiple entities without requiring additional annotations like `OneToOne` or `OneToMany` in JPA when using the API. However, it's essential to remember that NoSQL databases have varying behaviors. For instance, in a Document database, these entities may be converted into a subdocument, while on a Key-value, it will be the value.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private Address address;
}

@Entity
public class Address {

    @Column
    private String street;

    @Column
    private String city;
}
----

[source,json]
----
{
   "_id":10,
   "name":"Ada Lovelave",
   "address":{
      "city":"SÃ£o Paulo",
      "street":"Av Nove de Julho"
   }
}
----

==== @Column

This annotation defines which fields that belong to an Entity will be persisted. There is a single attribute that specifies that name in Database with a default value that is the field name as declared in the class. This annotation is mandatory for non-Key-Value database types. In Key-Value types, only the Key needs to be identified with the `@Key` annotation. All other fields are stored as a single BLOB.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {
    @Column
    private String nickname;

    @Column("personName")
    private String name;

    @Column
    private List<String> phones;

    // ignored
    private String address;
}
----

==== @Id

This annotation defines which attribute is the entity's ID, or the Key in Key-Value databases. In such a case, the Value is the remaining information. It has a single attribute (like `@Column`) to define the native name. Unlike `@Column`, the default value is `_id`.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    private String userName;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private List<String> phones;
}
